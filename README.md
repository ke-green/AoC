Advent of Code

This is just me having fun part-time trying to become better at JavaScript and learning some Node along the way. Also, I'm using VS Code for development, which is new to me as well.

My goal is to solve all the puzzles without getting help (cheating!). My free time is few and far between, so I ruled out getting them done quickly from the start!
